3. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.  
   After code is pushed with a github action. You can't guarantee people will run the tests before pushing, may as well publicly humiliate them. 
4. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)  
   No
5. No, unit tests are just for checking function input/output. Messaging requires a lot of pieces
   and an end to end test would probably be the best.
6. Yes, just a simple function so you can just test input/output. return string.length <= max_msg_len;
